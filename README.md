# Constantine.  Why Constantine? Because, our "syn bot" or "VA", is going to be as relentless and vigilant in searching for and creating our "site" content, just like the 13th century, "HOLY" Roman Emporer Constantine, was in pursuing his dynasty's emperial policies against the papacy! 

I would like to create a "syn bot" or "virtual assistant" that could handle the the entire task of finding/creating content for specific/niche, topics/subjects/objects, for blogs, websites, forums, podcats, etc...that would include: content of topic(details,pros/cons,5w's,purpose,opinion,facts,bibliography,dates,events), photos/images, videos, etc...

Content editor, creator and writer.Capable of searching through thousands of search engines to find the most relevant and latest content about a specific topic/subject/object. Also able to recognize, search, add, cut, copy, paste and edit photos/images that are the most identified, using the search engines to locate the content/image sources and authors/publishers of the information gathered, by the "bot", about the specified topic. Possibly have it compare all of it's gathered information to a verified, authenticated, source(s) of factual evidence and legitimacy of the gathered information, discarding all info., that cannot be proven factual through comparrison of a certified or verifiable resource.

*Allowed, verifiable resources would include: encyclopedias, "reputable" magazine publishers, any publishings of books, articles or documents, that the information they are providing, is a certafiable fact, given through conclusive physical evidence that supports their teachings and writings, about specific topic/product/subject/object.
